# Cplusplus-Program

#Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The project was about creating a clock to tell the time as well as have the user be able to change the time.
    
#What did you do particularly well?
What I did well on was creating an if statement with options for the user to edit the hours, minutes, and seconds of the clock.
    
#Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I believe the main part of the code would have been to create a switch statement instead of using if for the choices of the user.  This would shorten the lines                     needed to write the code as well as make it easier for other coworkers to understand or edit it if need to.
    
#Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
The most challenging part of the code was setting up a void in order to display the clock to the user.  The way I was able to get around this was by creating classes that can be called from inside the code.

#What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
The skills that I learned the most about this project was the use of void and classes working together in order to diplay the work as well as give options to the user to enter.    
    
#How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made this program readable by using if statements as well as naming the variables as something others can understand when looking back at the code and trying understand the structure behind it.
